# pomodoro
pomodoro app using Tkinter module in python
Decide on the task to be done.
Set the pomodoro timer (typically for 25 minutes).
Work on the task.
End work when the timer rings and take a short break (typically 5 min).[5]
If you have finished fewer than three pomodoros, go back to Step 2 and repeat until you go through all three pomodoros.
After four pomodoros are done, take the fourth pomodoro and then take a long break (typically 20 minutes).
